"One of the nice things about Desmos is that it understands a lot of different forms. A student could type 2*x, f(x)=2*x, y=2*x, or 2x, and we'd recognize those all as the same function. To take "
"advantage of that flexibility in the computation layer, you'll want to use simpleFunction. This takes latex and returns a function which can connect to a graph's \"function\" sink. You can then use "
