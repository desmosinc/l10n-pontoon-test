      We have updated all Marbleslides activities to be more screen reader
      friendly! These updates include verbal prompts to orient the student to the
      activity, optional sound effects so he or she can hear the marbles move
      around, and a text-based summary describing what happened after launching the
      marbles. The text description and audio cues track the first marble only.
    </2>
    <3>
      We have found that Marbleslides is very challenging to complete using screen
      reader and audio cues alone. Students who rely on a screen reader may wish to
      work with a sighted peer to complete this activity.
